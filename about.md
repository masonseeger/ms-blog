I am a Senior at [DePauw University](https://www.depauw.edu). I will be graduating with a Computer Science and Mathematics double major and a Japanese minor in May 2019. I am a member of Delta Upsilon International Fraternity Inc. I am part of the Information Technology Associates Program (ITAP) and the Science Research Fellows Program at DePauw University. As an ITAP intern I have worked in expanding my knowledge of technology. I spent a year working in 4 different rotations which spanned from teaching methods to GIS to working at DePauw's tech center. I spent two years working in the same tech center doing hardware and software related work for professors and faulty around campus. Work involved wiping and replacing hard drives, troubleshooting hardware and software issues, and updating computers. I spent the summer of 2017 researching [ensembles for housing price error prediction](/_posts/201806-26-Ensembels-for-housing-price-error-prediction.markdown). During the research we were awarded approximately $8,300 in resources from Extreme Science and Engineering Development Environment(XSEDE) by the NSF. The research was presented at the Midstates Conference for Undergraduate Research in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am also a part of the DePauw chapter of Order of Omega, an organization that recognizes outstanding scholarship and leadership amongst the Greek community.

For the Summer of 2018 I conducted research at Auburn University, Alabama in the field of AI. The research is focused on using LiDAR for a collision avoidance system. This research will be presented at the National Conference of Undergraduate Research in April 2019.

Currently I am working on different projects in computer science. I worked on a Automated RC car for my senior project and
participated in a hackathon where my team won first place.
