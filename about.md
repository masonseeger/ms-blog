I am a Senior at [DePauw University](https://www.depauw.edu). I am pursuing Computer Science and Mathematics double major with a Japanese minor. For the Summer of 2018 I am conducting research at Auburn University, Alabama in the field of AI. The research is focused on using LiDAR for a collision avoidance system.
