This post is going to be an on-going page that will detail the experience I have had researching at Auburn University in the field of Smart UAV's. Our research topic originated as making a homing system for a drone that has lost GPS signal. After much reading and discussion, the topic turned to using LiDAR and computer vision for object avoidance. The current focus is the detection and avoidance of dynamic objects.

There is not much more progress at this point other than extensive reading. We have ordered a LiDAR sensor, the xxx, and we are going to begin working with computer vision using a nondescript web camera and opencv or something like it in python or c++.
