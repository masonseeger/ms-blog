This post will be used to describe the research I did at DePauw University in the summer of 2017. The research focused on making ensembles for housing price error prediction. I was worked with Quan "Chris" Nguyen and we were supervised by Dr. Steven Bogaerts.

I hope to add information to this post soon!
